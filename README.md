# django_example
A sample project in Django

This is a super barebones sample project made with Django. It has two endpoints:
 - /login/
 - /user_page/

The /user_page/ endpoint is only accessible for logged-in users. Users can sign up and login at /login/ and then access their /user_page/.

In order to run:

```
python manage.py runserver
```
